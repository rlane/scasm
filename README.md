SCASM
=====

Introduction
------------

SCASM is an assembler for the DCPU-16 architecture used in the game 0x10c.
See the game's [official website](http://0x10c.com/) for details on the
instruction set. This assembler is different and powerful because the
code you write is actually Ruby, meaning you can use all the capabilities
of a high-level programming language to help generate the final machine code.
